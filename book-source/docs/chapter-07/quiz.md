    {
      id: "q-ch07-01",
      question: "What is the primary use of OpenAI Whisper in robotics?",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      options: [
        "Image generation",
        "Speech recognition and voice command processing",
        "Path planning",
        "Object detection"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "OpenAI Whisper is a state-of-the-art speech recognition system that converts audio to text. In robotics, it enables natural voice control, allowing users to speak commands instead of typing or using complex interfaces.",
      wrongAnswerExplanations: [
        "Whisper processes audio, not images",
        "Path planning is handled by navigation algorithms, not Whisper",
        "Object detection uses computer vision, not speech recognition"
      ]
    },
    {
      id: "q-ch07-02",
      question: "What is cognitive planning in the context of VLA?",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      options: [
        "Using LLMs to decompose high-level tasks into structured action sequences",
        "Planning robot movements using kinematics",
        "Computer vision processing",
        "Sensor fusion"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "Cognitive planning uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate natural language commands into detailed, structured action sequences. For example, 'Clean the room' becomes a sequence of navigation, object detection, and manipulation actions.",
      wrongAnswerExplanations: [
        "Kinematics planning is geometric, not cognitive",
        "Computer vision is perception, not planning",
        "Sensor fusion combines sensor data, not language understanding"
      ]
    },
    {
      id: "q-ch07-03",
      question: "Why is multi-modal interaction important in human-robot interaction?",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      options: [
        "It's always faster",
        "It provides redundancy, naturalness, and robustness",
        "It's always cheaper",
        "It's simpler to implement"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Multi-modal interaction (combining speech, vision, gesture) provides redundancy (if one modality fails, others compensate), creates more natural interfaces, and improves robustness in noisy or challenging environments.",
      wrongAnswerExplanations: [
        "Speed depends on implementation, not modality count",
        "Multi-modal systems can be more expensive due to additional sensors",
        "Multi-modal systems are typically more complex to implement"
      ]
    },
    {
      id: "q-ch07-04",
      question: "What is the main challenge when translating LLM-generated plans to ROS 2 actions?",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      options: [
        "LLMs can't generate plans",
        "Bridging high-level natural language plans to low-level ROS 2 commands",
        "ROS 2 doesn't support actions",
        "LLMs are too slow"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The challenge is translating abstract, high-level plans generated by LLMs (e.g., 'pick up the cup') into specific, executable ROS 2 action calls with proper parameters, error handling, and safety validation.",
      wrongAnswerExplanations: [
        "LLMs can generate plans, but translation is the challenge",
        "ROS 2 fully supports actions",
        "LLM inference speed is typically fast enough for planning"
      ]
    },
    {
      id: "q-ch07-05",
      question: "In the Capstone Project, what is the complete pipeline from voice to action?",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      options: [
        "Voice → Action",
        "Voice → LLM → Action",
        "Voice → Whisper → LLM Planning → ROS 2 Actions → Robot Execution",
        "Voice → Computer Vision → Action"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The complete VLA pipeline: 1) Voice input transcribed by Whisper, 2) LLM decomposes command into action plan, 3) Plan translated to ROS 2 actions, 4) Actions executed by robot (navigation, perception, manipulation).",
      wrongAnswerExplanations: [
        "Missing intermediate processing steps",
        "Missing Whisper transcription and ROS 2 translation",
        "Missing language understanding and planning steps"
      ]
    },
    {
      id: "q-ch07-06",
      question: "What is the purpose of validating LLM-generated plans before execution?",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      options: [
        "To make plans faster",
        "To ensure safety, feasibility, and correctness before robot execution",
        "To reduce memory usage",
        "To simplify the code"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Validation checks ensure LLM-generated plans are safe (no dangerous actions), feasible (within robot capabilities), and correct (proper parameters) before sending commands to physical hardware. This prevents errors and accidents.",
      wrongAnswerExplanations: [
        "Validation doesn't affect plan generation speed",
        "Validation doesn't reduce memory usage",
        "Validation adds complexity but is necessary for safety"
      ]
    },
    {
      id: "q-ch07-07",
      question: "How does sensor fusion improve multi-modal interaction?",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      options: [
        "It makes sensors cheaper",
        "It combines complementary information from different modalities for more robust perception",
        "It eliminates the need for sensors",
        "It only works with cameras"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Sensor fusion combines information from multiple modalities (speech, vision, gesture) to create a more complete understanding. For example, voice command 'pick up the red cup' combined with visual object detection identifies the correct target.",
      wrongAnswerExplanations: [
        "Fusion doesn't affect sensor cost",
        "Sensors are still needed for each modality",
        "Fusion works with any combination of sensors"
      ]
    },
    {
      id: "q-ch07-08",
      question: "What makes the Capstone Project 'The Autonomous Humanoid' a complete VLA system?",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      options: [
        "It only uses voice commands",
        "It integrates voice recognition, cognitive planning, navigation, perception, and manipulation end-to-end",
        "It only uses computer vision",
        "It doesn't use ROS 2"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The Capstone integrates the complete VLA pipeline: voice input (Whisper), task planning (LLM), path planning (Nav2), object detection (computer vision), and manipulation (humanoid hands) - all orchestrated through ROS 2.",
      wrongAnswerExplanations: [
        "It uses multiple components, not just voice",
        "It uses multiple components, not just vision",
        "ROS 2 is essential for orchestrating all components"
      ]
    },
    {
      id: "q-ch07-09",
      question: "What is the advantage of using actions over services for robot tasks in VLA systems?",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      options: [
        "Actions are always faster",
        "Actions provide progress feedback for long-running tasks like navigation",
        "Actions don't require ROS 2",
        "Actions are simpler to implement"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Actions are designed for long-running tasks (like navigation) that take time to complete. They provide progress feedback, can be canceled, and handle failures gracefully - essential for complex robot behaviors.",
      wrongAnswerExplanations: [
        "Actions may take longer due to task complexity",
        "Actions are a ROS 2 feature",
        "Actions are more complex than services but provide needed functionality"
      ]
    },
    {
      id: "q-ch07-10",
      question: "In prompt engineering for LLM-based planning, what information should be included?",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      options: [
        "Only the user command",
        "User command, available robot actions, safety constraints, and desired output format",
        "Only safety constraints",
        "Only the output format"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Effective prompts include: the user's command, available robot actions/capabilities, safety constraints, current environment context, and the desired output format (e.g., JSON). This enables the LLM to generate safe, feasible plans.",
      wrongAnswerExplanations: [
        "More context is needed for reliable planning",
        "Command and actions are also essential",
        "Command and constraints are also essential"
