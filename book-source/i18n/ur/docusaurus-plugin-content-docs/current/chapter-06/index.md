## Overview

Humanoid robots replicate human form and movement, presenting unique challenges in balance, locomotion, and interaction. This chapter covers bipedal walking, whole-body control, and human-robot interaction fundamentals.

**Learning Objectives**:
- Understand humanoid robot kinematics and dynamics
- Implement bipedal walking gaits with stability criteria
- Design balance controllers for inverted pendulum dynamics
- Plan whole-body motions respecting center-of-mass constraints
- Master manipulation and grasping with humanoid hands
- Apply compliant control for safe physical interaction
- Design natural human-robot interaction systems
