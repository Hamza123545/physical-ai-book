# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

**Part of**: Weeks 1-2 - Foundation (Introduction to Physical AI)  
**Course Structure**: This chapter covers the foundational weeks before Module 1 begins.

Welcome to the first chapter of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! This chapter establishes the foundational concepts you'll need for all subsequent chapters.

## 🎯 Chapter Overview

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with the physical world through robotics. Unlike software-only AI that operates in digital environments, Physical AI systems must perceive, reason about, and interact with the real world in real-time.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

In this chapter, you will:

1. **Understand Physical AI** - Learn what makes embodied AI different from traditional software AI
2. **Recognize Key Challenges** - Understand real-time constraints, sensor noise, and safety requirements
3. **Master Sensor & Actuator Basics** - Learn how robots perceive and act in the world
4. **Start Python Robotics Programming** - Build your first robot simulations with NumPy and Matplotlib

## 🗓️ Chapter Structure

This chapter contains **4 lessons** (approximately 180 minutes total):

- **DigComp Level**: 2-3 (Basic to Intermediate digital competence)

## ✅ Chapter Assessment

After completing all lessons, test your knowledge with the **[Chapter 1 Quiz](./quiz.md)**:
- 50 questions covering all lessons
- Distribution: 12 questions per lesson (L1, L4), 13 questions each (L2, L3)
- Immediate feedback with detailed explanations
- Randomized batching (15-20 questions per attempt)

## 🔗 Prerequisites

This is the **foundational chapter** - no prerequisites required! However, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge (variables, loops, functions)
- High school level mathematics (algebra, basic trigonometry)
- Familiarity with basic AI/ML concepts (helpful but not required)

## 📝 Content Creation Workflow

**Workflow Note**: This chapter was created during the initial textbook development phase (November 2025) using direct content creation. Starting with Chapter 5, all content is created using the `physical-ai-content-writer` subagent workflow, which enforces Constitution v6.0.0 compliance through:

- **4-Layer Teaching Method**: Foundation → Application → Integration → Innovation
- **AI Three Roles Framework**: Teacher, Copilot, Evaluator roles in exercises
- **CEFR Cognitive Load Management**: B1-B2 proficiency-appropriate content
- **SpecKit Plus Workflow**: Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement with validation gates

This chapter has been audited for constitution compliance and contains all required pedagogical elements.
